# Title on pics
A simple script to add a text (title + subtitle) over a background image, to avoid using a complex photo-editing software.  
This script first crops the image to 304 x 405, then adjust the brightness and attaches the text.
## Prerequisites
- Python3
- Pillow (install with `pip install Pillow`)
## Running
Run `GUI.py`, then choose an image to load, write title and subtitle and click on "GO".  
The result will be saved in the same folder of the image with the name `car_result.jpg`
